      In 2003, Erasmus MC took the first steps in order to establish a Center
      for Bioinformatics. Located in the heart of the biomedical research
      activities of Erasmus MC, this high-tech bioinformatics department is
      equipped with a state of the art hard- and software. In collaboration
      with other departments the centerâ€™s multidisciplinary team supports
      projects that generate genetics, genomics and proteomics data from basic
      research, forensics studies, molecular diagnostics and clinical trials.

      The center also runs a research program of its own, which provides the
      biological and technological basis of all the other activities. The
      research focuses on the way the genome as a whole contributes to the
      evolution, development, structure and function of the brain. It involves
      analysis of gene expression in cells of the brain and combines genomics,
      proteomics and cytogenetic data to identify genes associated with
      neurological disorders or craniofacial and extremity malformations.
