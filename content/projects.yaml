          MyFAIR Analysis is a web application designed to allow scientists to
          create FAIR data, and to provide FAIR data analysis such that the
          “end to end” analysis complies with FAIR data principles. MyFAIR
          analysis is a python application and graphical user interface (GUI)
          that uses Galaxy2 for analytical workflows and B2DROP3(EUDAT) for FAIR
          data storage.  Our proof of concept to test myFAIR analysis uses the
          genome in a bottle trio-samples available from galaxy training for
          genetic variation analysis.
