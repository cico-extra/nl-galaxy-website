        <h1>Welcome to the Dutch national Galaxy Chooser</h1>
        <p>Many biological data workflows are available through Galaxy servers. In The Netherlands, collaborations to maintain a
            galaxy server together exist since 2009. Since those days, it has become easier to maintain galaxy servers. For users 
            looking to test or run data analyses, there are therefore different options.</p>
        <h2>National service(s)</h2>
        <p>For the current incarnation of a Dutch National Galaxy service, with limited resources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://galaxy.nbic.nl">http://galaxy.nbic.nl/</a>
        </ul>
        <h2>Institutional service(s)</h2>
        <p>Institutional services will appear here. In the more distant future maybe even based on your institutional login.</p>
        <h2>If all else fails</h2>
        <p>If you don't find what you need above, there is always the world-wide server at 
            <a href="http://usegalaxy.org/">http://usegalaxy.org</a>. You can also try to contact the national support desk 
            at SURFsara.</p>
        <h2>Galaxy training</h2>
