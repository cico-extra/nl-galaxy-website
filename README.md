landing page for choosegalaxy.nl, view at https://shiltemann.github.io/choosegalaxy/

## Updating the page

To add content to the page, the only file you need to edit are the `yaml` files in the `metadata` directory.

To preview your local changes, make sure you have jekyll installed and run:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

from the root of the repo, then point your browser to `localhost:4000`

When you are satisfied with your changes, push your changes to the master branch and the site will be automatically updated
